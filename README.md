**PLEASE UPDATE THIS README TO INCLUDE:**
* a text description of how to run your program, 
* document any idiosyncrasies, behaviors, or bugs of note that you want us to be aware of when grading, and
* any other comments that you feel are relevant.

Executing program:
- Simply open up the index.html locally and choose a file to upload.


Description:
- The image you upload will rotate counter clockwise at 0.02 degrees per tick. It should finish a cycle every few seconds
- I initially had the image rotate as a rectangle with parts of it 'cutting off' but it looked a little awkward in that way. So, currently, the image we upload will be treated like an image that's infinitely repeating, so during rotations you may see bunnies adjacent to our original bunny. I thought this looked much better and there isn't much difference functionally.

Included files (**PLEASE ADD/UPDATE THIS LIST**):
* index.html    -- a sample html file with a canvas
* a01.js        -- a sample javascript file for functionality with the image uploading, and a method to parse PPM images
* MathUtilities.js		-- some math functions that you can use and extend yourself. It contains matrix manipulations
* bunny.ppm     -- a test image
